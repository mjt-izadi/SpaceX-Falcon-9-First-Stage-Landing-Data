# Falcon 9 First-Stage Landing Data
## Analyzing the Success Rate of SpaceX's Falcon 9 First-Stage Landings

SpaceX, the aerospace company, has pioneered the Falcon 9 launch vehicle, featuring a partially reusable design. This innovation has significantly impacted launch costs, with SpaceX's advertised cost for Falcon 9 rocket launches being $62 million, in contrast to other providers charging upwards of $165 million per launch. The key to this cost difference lies in SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket.

However, not all attempts at first-stage landings have been successful. Sometimes the first stage fails to land properly, leading to a crash. In other cases, SpaceX may intentionally sacrifice the first stage due to mission parameters such as payload requirements, orbit specifications, or customer preferences.

This project has these components:
* Data collection
* Data wrangling
* Exploratory data analysis
* Development of a visualization dashboard
* Implementation of machine learning models
